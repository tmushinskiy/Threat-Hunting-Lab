# Threat Hunting Lab

## Objective

The Threat Hunting Lab project is designed to develop proactive detection skills by enabling hypothesis-driven exploration of log and network data. The goal is to identify suspicious behavior and threats that evade traditional security tools. This lab emphasizes using free and open-source tools to perform deep analysis, correlate events, and pivot through data to uncover hidden indicators of compromise (IOCs).

### Skills Learned

- Hypothesis-based threat hunting methodology  
- Pivoting through multi-source logs to trace adversary activity  
- Identifying anomalies and patterns in endpoint and network telemetry  
- Building search queries and dashboards for visibility  
- IOC extraction, correlation, and threat narrative development  

### Tools Used

- **Sysmon** – Endpoint telemetry and event logging  
- **Zeek** – Network traffic logging and analysis  
- **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – Log ingestion, querying, and visualization  
- **Kibana** – Dashboard creation and log correlation  
- **Sigma** – Rule writing and log-based detection mapping  
- **CyberChef** – Data decoding, transformation, and IOC extraction  
- **Winlogbeat** – Windows event forwarding into Elasticsearch
